We propose a novel physics-aware cross-domain fusion network (CDFN) for computer-generated holography (CGH). The network combines physical insights with deep learning to achieve high-quality holographic reconstruction. Our key contributions include:

* A novel cross-domain fusion architecture that integrates physical knowledge with learning-based methods
* An iterative phase mapping strategy for improved phase optimization
* Deep supervision mechanism to enhance network training
* Comprehensive experiments demonstrating superior performance in holographic reconstruction

The proposed CDFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction quality and computational efficiency, showing great potential for practical holographic display applications.
