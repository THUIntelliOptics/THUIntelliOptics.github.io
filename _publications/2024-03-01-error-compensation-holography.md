We propose an error-compensation network specifically designed to reduce ringing artifacts in computer-generated holograms (CGHs). Our approach introduces a specialized network architecture that effectively compensates for errors in the holographic reconstruction process. Key features include:

* Novel error-compensation mechanism for artifact reduction
* Specialized network architecture for holographic displays
* Efficient training strategy using DIV2K dataset
* Significant improvement in reconstruction quality

The network demonstrates superior performance in reducing ringing artifacts compared to traditional methods, making it particularly valuable for practical holographic display applications.

Implementation Details
======
* Supports multiple color channels (red, green, blue)
* Built on PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning
* Trained on DIV2K dataset
* Efficient and practical for real-world applications
